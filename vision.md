# Vision

As a Pathfinder Player, i want to minimize the hassle of the necessary bookkeeping task for playing.

As a Pathfinder Player, i want to access information during sessions in a quick way.

As a Pathfinder Player, i want to collaborate with my team mates.

## Less Bookkeeping hassle

### Definition of Bookkeeping

This is bookkeeping work:

- Known Spell List
- Prepared Spells
- Inventory Transactions
- Money Transactions
- Campaign Systems, like Buildings, Rooms, Teams and Capital generation
- Experience

This is **not** bookkeeping work:

- HitPoints
- Leveling up

### How does bookkeeping without this application work?

- Pen & Paper: writing everything down
  - Pro: Easy, Cheap
  - Con: Bad Scaling (e. g. searching for specific information), Manual Synchronization
- Online Resources: Forums, Wikis, Cloud Storage
  - Pro: Cheap version available, distributed editing possible
  - Con: Technical Know-How needed for setup, Unoptimized Mobile Versions
- Mobile Apps: SRD, spell books, X Generator, colorful CharacterSheets, Initiative Tracker, Dice Roller
  - Pro: Spellbook Management (some)
  - Con: No bookkeeping, Switching between apps necessary

### How to improve bookkeeping

- Data is personal and thus stored on your mobile device (backing up to a storage is still a good idea)
- Every character has his own bookkeeping
- Data Entry through user input
- Data Entry through data transfer
- Searchable data stores

## Access Information during Sessions



## Collaboration with Team Mates
